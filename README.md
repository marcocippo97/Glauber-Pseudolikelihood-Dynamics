# Glauber-Pseudolikelihood-Dynamics
This repository contains the code in Julia language related to my master degree's thesis work, regarding the generation of  artificial proteins through the means of pseudolikelihood maximization.

The PCA package is devoted to the principal components analysis, while the PseudoLikelihoodGenerator one contains the main functions of this project, included in the \src folder.

The \data folder regroups all the results of my computations.
